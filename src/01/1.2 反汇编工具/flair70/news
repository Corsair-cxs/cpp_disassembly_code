sigmake
-------

1.31	keep collisioned modules as unnamed modules
1.32	fixed bug with directory names in input files
1.33	don't keep collisions in startup signatures

        defined bytes now

        functions names are not allowed there
1.42    refer to the docs in the collisions message
1.43    added new processor codes to -hp help page
1.44    V7 signature files are created (standard zip lib)
1.45    global name have priority over local names
        if we have several of them on the same address
1.46    maximum number of excluded names is 64000
1.47    -r to not use fixup information
